# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhancement aims to significantly expand the portfolio website's capabilities by adding comprehensive project management functionality, Mermaid diagram rendering support, and fixing the existing blog system. The enhancement will transform the static project showcase into a dynamic platform where detailed project information, research documentation, tutorials, and system architecture diagrams can be effectively displayed and managed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to view detailed project information including comprehensive descriptions, tutorials, and system architecture diagrams, so that I can better understand the depth and technical complexity of the showcased work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a project THEN the system SHALL display an expanded project detail page with comprehensive information
2. WHEN viewing a project detail page THEN the system SHALL render Mermaid diagrams embedded in project documentation
3. WHEN a project contains tutorials THEN the system SHALL display them in an organized, easy-to-follow format
4. WHEN a project has system architecture documentation THEN the system SHALL render it with proper formatting and diagram support

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As the portfolio owner, I want to create and manage projects through markdown files in a dedicated projects folder, so that I can easily add detailed project information by simply creating or updating markdown documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new project THEN the system SHALL allow me to add a markdown file to the projects folder
2. WHEN a markdown file is added to the projects folder THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and display it as a new project
3. WHEN updating a project markdown file THEN the system SHALL reflect changes on the website without requiring code changes
4. WHEN organizing projects THEN the system SHALL use the markdown filename or frontmatter to determine project metadata

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to see Mermaid diagrams properly rendered in project documentation, so that I can understand system architectures and technical workflows visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing content with Mermaid code blocks THEN the system SHALL render them as interactive diagrams
2. WHEN a Mermaid diagram fails to render THEN the system SHALL display a fallback with the raw code and an error message
3. WHEN viewing rendered diagrams THEN the system SHALL provide zoom and pan functionality for complex diagrams
4. WHEN diagrams are rendered THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design across different screen sizes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to access a functional blog section, so that I can read articles and insights from the portfolio owner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the blog section THEN the system SHALL display a list of published blog posts without errors
2. WHEN clicking on a blog post THEN the system SHALL navigate to the full article content
3. WHEN viewing blog posts THEN the system SHALL properly render markdown content with formatting
4. WHEN the Notion API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and fallback content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As the portfolio owner, I want to categorize and organize projects by type and status, so that visitors can easily find relevant projects and understand my current work focus.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the projects section THEN the system SHALL display projects organized by categories (current, completed, research, etc.)
2. WHEN filtering projects THEN the system SHALL allow visitors to view projects by technology stack, date, or project type
3. WHEN a project is marked as "currently building" THEN the system SHALL highlight it prominently
4. WHEN projects have different statuses THEN the system SHALL display appropriate badges and indicators

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to navigate between different project views and content types seamlessly, so that I can explore the portfolio efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN navigating between project views THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent navigation patterns
2. WHEN viewing detailed project content THEN the system SHALL provide breadcrumb navigation
3. WHEN switching between projects THEN the system SHALL preserve user context and provide smooth transitions
4. WHEN accessing different content types THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent styling and layout

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a portfolio visitor, I want to view rich markdown content with embedded media and interactive elements, so that I can experience project documentation similar to Notion's rendering capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing project markdown content THEN the system SHALL render all standard markdown elements (headers, lists, links, emphasis)
2. WHEN markdown contains embedded images THEN the system SHALL display them with proper sizing and optimization
3. WHEN markdown contains tables THEN the system SHALL render them with responsive styling and proper formatting
4. WHEN markdown contains embedded PDFs THEN the system SHALL provide inline PDF viewing or download options
5. WHEN markdown contains code blocks THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting and copy functionality

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As the portfolio owner, I want comprehensive markdown rendering that supports advanced features, so that I can create rich, interactive project documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing markdown content THEN the system SHALL support frontmatter for project metadata (title, date, tags, status)
2. WHEN including media in markdown THEN the system SHALL support relative path references to project assets
3. WHEN creating complex layouts THEN the system SHALL support custom markdown extensions for enhanced formatting
4. WHEN content includes interactive elements THEN the system SHALL render them appropriately (collapsible sections, tabs, etc.)
