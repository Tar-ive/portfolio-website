## ✍️ Writing Blog Posts

Blog posts are stored as Markdown files inside `content/blog`. Each file uses frontmatter metadata to provide the title, description, publication date, and author information.

To publish a new post:

1. Create a new `.md` file in `content/blog` with YAML frontmatter:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: "My Post Title"
   description: "A short summary that appears on the blog index."
   date: "2024-05-01"
   author: "Your Name"
   published: true
   ---

   ## Your content starts here
   ```

2. Commit the file and push it to GitHub.
3. Deploy the site (or wait for the next automated deployment). The blog page will automatically list the new post.
