# Bobcat Bounty Inventory System

A comprehensive food pantry management system developed during Hackacat Nano at Texas State University, addressing food insecurity on campus through innovative technology solutions.

## Overview

Developed during Hackacat Nano at Texas State University (7-hour hackathon), this project addresses food insecurity on campus through Bobcat Bounty, a student-run food pantry. The application features real-time inventory tracking, AI-powered recipe suggestions, and dietary information for food items.

## The Problem

Food insecurity is a significant issue affecting college students nationwide. At Texas State University, many students struggle with reliable access to nutritious food, impacting their academic performance and overall well-being.
