# Grants.gov MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables Anthropic's Claude to fetch and analyze grants data directly from grants.gov. This tool bridges the gap between AI assistance and government funding opportunities.

## Overview

I recently built an MCP which lets Anthropic's Claude fetch grants data from grants.gov. This integration allows for seamless discovery and analysis of federal funding opportunities directly within Claude conversations.

## Key Features

### üîç **Smart Grant Search**
- Search for grants by keyword across all federal agencies
- Advanced filtering by funding amount, deadline, and eligibility criteria
- Real-time access to the latest grant opportunities

### üìä **Detailed Grant Information** 
- Comprehensive grant details including funding amounts and deadlines
- Eligibility requirements and application procedures
- Agency contact information and application links

### üóÇÔ∏è **Pagination Support**
- Navigate through large result sets efficiently
- Configurable results per page
- Seamless browsing of extensive grant databases

### üéØ **Claude Integration**
- Native integration with Claude's conversation flow
- Contextual grant recommendations based on research topics
- Instant grant analysis and comparison

## Technical Implementation

Built using the Model Context Protocol specification, this server provides Claude with the capability to:

- Execute real-time searches against the grants.gov API
- Parse and format complex grant data structures
- Provide structured responses for optimal readability
- Handle API rate limiting and error scenarios gracefully

## Use Cases

- **Researchers** seeking funding for academic projects
- **Nonprofits** looking for federal grant opportunities
- **Startups** exploring government funding programs
- **Grant writers** needing quick access to opportunity details

## Impact

This MCP server democratizes access to federal funding information by making it easily searchable and analyzable through natural language conversations with Claude. No more manual browsing through complex government databases.

The tool has been recognized by the AI community for its practical utility in bridging AI capabilities with government data access.
